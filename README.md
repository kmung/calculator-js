Calculator web app in js

I had to use JavaScript for an algorithm class but actually never really learned it step by step. This repo is my practice in coding in JavaScript to create a calculator web app.

The code here are not originally of my own, even though I have tweaked and added to it to customize it to my liking.

The original code is from a tutorial, of which the repo can be found here: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator
